Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic
problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in
fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent
possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major
storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as
well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

Synopsis
========

The analysis on the storm event database revealed that tornadoes are the most
dangerous weather event to the population health. The second most dangerous
event type is the excessive heat. The economic impact of weather events was
also analyzed. Flash floods and thunderstorm winds caused billions of dollars
in property damages between 1950 and 2011. The largest crop damage caused by
drought, followed by flood and hails.


Data Processing
===============

The analysis was performed on
[Storm Events Database](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/ftp.jsp), provided by
[National Climatic Data Center](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/). The data is from a comma-separated-value file available
[here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).
There is also some documentation of the data available
[here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf).

There is also some documentation of the data available
[here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf).

The first step is to set the directory and read the data into a data frame.
```{r cache=TRUE}
setwd("~/GitHub/reproductive-research-peer2")
data <- read.csv(file="repdata-data-StormData.csv",header=TRUE)
```

Before the analysis, the step of preprocessing is essential. The events with types `Frost/Freeze`,
`FROST/FREEZE` and `FROST\\FREEZE` they fall inot the same group. Also there are two columns for
for propert and crop damagies, one for the quantity ("PROPDMG","CROPDMG") 
and the second for range(("PROPDMGEXP","CROPDMGEXP")), we join into a single numeric vector in order 
to proceed properly to aggregation step


```{r}
# number of unique event types
length(unique(storm$EVTYPE))
# translate all letters to lowercase
event_types <- tolower(storm$EVTYPE)
# replace all punct. characters with a space
event_types <- gsub("[[:blank:][:punct:]+]", " ", event_types)
length(unique(event_types))
# update the data frame
colout$EVTYPE <- event_types

colout$PROPDMGEXP <- mapvalues(colout$PROPDMGEXP, from = c("H", "K","M","B"), to = c(100, 1000,1000000,
                                                                                 1000000000))
colout$PROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(as.character(colout$PROPDMGEXP))
colout$PROPDMGEXP <- colout$PROPDMG * colout$PROPDMGEXP
colout$CROPDMGEXP <- mapvalues(colout$CROPDMGEXP, from = c("?","","H", "K","M","B"), to = c(0,0,100, 1000,1000000,
                                                                                     1000000000))
colout$CROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(as.character(colout$CROPDMGEXP))
colout$CROPDMGEXP <- colout$CROPDMG * colout$CROPDMGEXP
```




Dangerous Events with respect to Population Health
================================================

To find the event types that are most harmful to population health and property damage, the number
of casualties are aggregated by the event type.

```{r}
aggdata <- aggregate(cbind(FATALITIES, INJURIES,PROPDMG, PROPDMGEXP, CROPDMG, CROPDMGEXP) ~ EVTYPE, colout, sum,na.rm=TRUE)

# Find events that caused most death and injury
fatal_events <- head(casualties[order(casualties$fatalities, decreasing = T), ], 10)
injury_events <- head(casualties[order(casualties$injuries, decreasing = T), ], 10)
```

Economic Effects of Weather Events
==================================

To analyze the impact of weather events on the economy, available property
damage and crop damage reportings/estimates were used.

In the raw data, the property damage is represented with two fields, a number
`PROPDMG` in dollars and the exponent `PROPDMGEXP`. Similarly, the crop damage
is represented using two fields, `CROPDMG` and `CROPDMGEXP`. The first step in the
analysis is to calculate the property and crop damage for each event.
We did this in preprocessing step

```{r}
colout$PROPDMGEXP <- mapvalues(colout$PROPDMGEXP, from = c("H", "K","M","B"), to = c(100, 1000,1000000,
                                                                                 1000000000))
colout$PROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(as.character(colout$PROPDMGEXP))
colout$PROPDMGEXP <- colout$PROPDMG * colout$PROPDMGEXP
colout$CROPDMGEXP <- mapvalues(colout$CROPDMGEXP, from = c("?","","H", "K","M","B"), to = c(0,0,100, 1000,1000000,
                                                                                     1000000000))
colout$CROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(as.character(colout$CROPDMGEXP))
colout$CROPDMGEXP <- colout$CROPDMG * colout$CROPDMGEXP
```

colout$CROPDMGEXP <- colout$CROPDMG * colout$CROPDMGEXP
```







Top 10 events that caused most property damage (in dollars) are as follows

```{r}
crop_damages <- head(aggdata[order(aggdata$CROPDMGEXP, decreasing = T), ], 10)
```

Similarly, the events that caused biggest crop damage are

```{r}
prop_damages <- head(aggdata[order(aggdata$PROPDMGEXP, decreasing = T), ], 10)
```

Results (data vizualization)

Health impact of weather events
-------------------------------

The following plot shows top dangerous weather event types.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p1 <- ggplot(data=crop_damages,
             aes(x=reorder(EVTYPE, FATALITIES), y=FATALITIES, fill=FATALITIES)) +
        geom_histogram(stat="identity") +
        ylab("Total number of property damagies") +
        xlab("Event type") +
        theme(legend.position="none")

p2 <- ggplot(data=crop_damages,
             aes(x=reorder(EVTYPE, INJURIES), y=INJURIES, fill=INJURIES)) +
        geom_histogram(stat="identity") +
        ylab("Total number of crop damagies") +
        xlab("Event type") +
        theme(legend.position="none")

multiplot(p1,p2)
```



Tornadoes cause most number of deaths and injuries among all event types. There 
are more than 5,000 deaths and more than 10,000 injuries in the last 60 years
in US, due to tornadoes. 
The other event types that are most dangerous with respect to population health
are excessive heat and flash floods.

Economic impact of weather events
---------------------------------

The following plot shows the most severe weather event types with respect to
economic cost that they have costed since 1950s.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
p3 <- ggplot(data=crop_damages,
             aes(x=reorder(EVTYPE, PROPDMGEXP), y=PROPDMGEXP, fill=PROPDMGEXP)) +
        geom_histogram(stat="identity") +
        ylab("Total number of property damagies") +
        xlab("Event type") +
        theme(legend.position="none")

p4 <- ggplot(data=crop_damages,
             aes(x=reorder(EVTYPE, CROPDMGEXP), y=CROPDMGEXP, fill=CROPDMGEXP)) +
        geom_histogram(stat="identity") +
        ylab("Total number of crop damagies") +
        xlab("Event type") +
        theme(legend.position="none")

multiplot(p3,p4)
```



Property damages are given in logarithmic scale due to large range of values.
The data shows that flood and hurricane typhoon cost the largest
property damages among weather-related natural diseasters. Note that, some variables
can be grouped in more efficient way (for instance, all the floods) to exctract a better
view of the causes.

The most severe weather event in terms of crop damage is the flood. In the last
half century, the drought has caused more than 10 billion dollars damage. Other
severe crop-damage-causing event types are floods and hails.
